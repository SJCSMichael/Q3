		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I was born and raised in South Carolina with my two older brothers, Thomas and Mark. I have a dog named Sandy. My brothers and I like to play video games together, and we play soccer together. I took intro to web design because I saw that my brothers did cool things with coding and I wanted to try it out myself.</p>

		<h2>Where do I see myself?</h2>
		<p>In five years, I probably see myself in college because at that time I would be a senior. I haven't thought very long about where I want to go to college but Clemson is a safe bet because I am interested in engineering. In ten years, I have no idea what I am going to do to be honest. I haven't looked in that much depth about what I want as a job, but a chemical engineer could be interesting.</p>
